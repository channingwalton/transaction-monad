/**
  * This is a builder for the monad transformer stack of EitherT over ReaderWriterStateT
  * that helps you construct TransactionF without having to specify all the types
  * all the time which is noisy and tedious.
  *
  * Once you've constructed this builder, you can import `builder._` so that
  * you can use its methods, its syntax, and get the list monoid so you don't
  * need to remember to import it from cats. That last point is important
  * because if you don't get the list monoid then you will get complex
  * complication errors about missing implicit instances for Monad that
  * will mislead and frustrate you.
